- Confidence scores for predictions  
- User-friendly interface with real-time results

*Installation*  
Step-by-step guide to set up the environment and run the project locally.

*Usage*  
How to use the web app to upload images and get predictions.

*Technologies Used*  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- Flask  
- OpenCV  
- HTML/CSS/JS  

*Dataset*  
Details about the skin disease image dataset used.

*Model*
